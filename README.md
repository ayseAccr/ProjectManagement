# ProjectManagement
Basic CRUD app using Springboot2 and Thymeleaf. H2 Database is used.
Simply, using Jpa Hibernate, a one-to-many relationship is established between the Project entity and the employees, 
and a many-to-one relationship between the employee entity and the project.

I'm still in the development and learning phase.
